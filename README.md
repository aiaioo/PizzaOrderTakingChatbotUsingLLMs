# Slides for NASSCOM Engineering and Design Summit, Bangalore, 2024

Here are the slides and the code for the NASSCOM Summit keynote talk by Cohan Sujay Carlos, CEO of Mechanical Chef, and Arvind Singh Gulati (ex-CTO of BicycleAI).

The talk was about how LLMs work and how they can be used in production systems.

We covered in particular how they can be programmed conversationally using a multi-agent technique called AutoGen.

As a demo, we presented an order-taking chatbot that Arvind Singh had built.

This repo contains the code for the same.

You can also watch the demo (Arvind running the code) on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gkWBz52Yzg.
